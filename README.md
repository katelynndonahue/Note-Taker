# Note-Taker
## Description
An application called Note Taker that can be used to write and save notes. This application uses Express.js on the back end and saves and retrieves note data from a JSON file.
- My motivation was to design an app that creates and saves notes using what was learned the previous week during the Express.js portion of the curriculum.
- This application organizes and displays important information and lists tasks orderly in a clean and aesthetically pleasing page.

## Installation
I began by creating uniquely named repository in GitHub. I then cloned the SSH Key to my local terminal to work locally through VS Code. From there, I started by creating all of my necessary files and began looking through the given material to determine my next steps.
## Usage
To use the application, simply give your note a title and write your note on the two given text lines and click the save icon to save to local storage. Click the + icon to add a new note.
Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

## How to Contribute
